	\subsection*{Data} % (fold)
	Data used will be video collected with an iPhone or Android phone.  As the
	goal is explained below, we would like to work with noisy data, so data
	acquired freely by consumer devices such as these should suffice.

	The project will be a collaboration between Nicolas Feltman and Alex
	Beutel.  As we are not yet sure of the amount of work for math,
	programming, and writing we are not sure how to divide the project.  We
	would both like to play an active role in all parts of the work, but will
	split it up further as we get a better sense of the work required.

	We also plan to meet with Professor Geoff Gordon regularly to discuss the
	progress of the project, since it is closely related to his research.
