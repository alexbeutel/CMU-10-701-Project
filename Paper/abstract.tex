In this project, we employ a naive Bayes Gaussian mixture model to detect
outliers in a set of image-feature traces derived from SIFT and KLT analysis of
unstable video data.  We identify two applications: 1) preprocessing data for
standard structure-from motion algorithms, and 2) robust motion detection and
isolation in presence of shaky video.  In the first application, we find
improvement of up to 94\% in our decomposability metric for some scenes.  In
the second application, we show a strong ability to disentangle scene motion
from camera motion.
